# Marlin Firmware (2.1.2.1) Configuration
This repo houses my personal config files for the Marlin firmware for my 3D printer(s).

These files are (most likely), still subject to the original license, GPLv3. See [here](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/release-2.1.2.1) for the original configuration.
